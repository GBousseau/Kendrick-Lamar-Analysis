# Kendrick Lamar's music analysis
Tags : ETL, Unsupervised Learning, Clustering, Recommendation system, Interpretation

Time Spent: 1day

Content : An exploration of Kendrick Lamar's music including : 
- Data cleaning
- First quick analysis
- Definition of 3 clusters for different type of songs + interpretation and analysis 
- Construction of a recommendation system based on the clustering

Important precision : 
- I did this project before my ML class started so by my own
- Because I used dynamic visuals with plot.express, some visuals are not displayed in the GitHub preview. You can find them in the folder "Interactive visuals" or explore them right here by downloading them.
**I STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU TO THROW AN EYE TO THE K-MEAN CLUSTERING**
